# Hi, I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.compbio.cmu.edu">Joint Carnegie Mellon - University of Pittsburgh PhD program in Computational Biology</a> where I am advised by <a href="http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/">David Koes</a>. I am broadly interested in machine learning methods for molecular discovery.  My PhD thesis is focused on developing deep generative models for structure-based drug design.
